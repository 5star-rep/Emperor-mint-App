# Emperors NFT minting dapp 🔥

This repo provides a nice and easy way for linking an existing Nft smart contract to this minting dapp, but has now been transformed to Emperor coin yield staking dapp.

There are two ways of using this repo, you can go the simple route or the more complex one.

The simple route is so simple, all you need to do is download the build folder on the release page and change the configuration to fit your needs. (Follow the video for a walk through).

The more complex route allows you to add additional functionality if you are comfortable with coding in react.js. (Follow the below instructions for a walk through).

## Installation 🛠️

If you are cloning the project then run this first, otherwise you can download the source code on the release page and skip this step.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/5star-rep/Emperor-mint-App/
```

Make sure you have node.js installed so you can use npm, then run:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage ℹ️

Download the zip file and extract it on your VSC.

```

After extracting, you might not need to make any changes. Just save all files, go to the terminal and run.

```sh
npm run start
```

Or create the build if you are ready to deploy.

```sh
npm run build
```

Now you can host the contents of the build folder on a server.

That's it! you're done.
